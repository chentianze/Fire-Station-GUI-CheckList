# Fire-Station-GUI-CheckList
Python Tkinter GUI Equipment Checklist For Fire Station

In fire stations, morning equipment checks are crucial as equipment functionability will directly impact the outcome of fire & rescue operations. Current method of recording equipment status is to physically tick them on the printed equipment checklist kept in a file. However, it can be quite demanding for firefighters to update the checklists while navigating the equipment in the narrow cabins of the firefighting vessel. Furthermore, keeping physcal records for future references can be spacious and misplaced easily.

By creating a digital prototype of the checklists, this project aims to achieve the following objectives:
  1. Improve convenience of firefighters during their daily equipment checks.
  2. Instant retrieval of past entries for reference.
  3. Reduce the need of printing and storing hardcopy checklists.
